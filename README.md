# SEO-OnPage-Checklist-Tool
This weekend, I built this tool to save my time checking source code of a page (for on page SEO activities). 

And if you've come across this tool and think it has the potential to save your time, then please star this repo. 

This will keep me motivated to build interesting projects.

Cheers!
